title: "Directions for using Condition functions"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
source("R/RelConditionEPU.R")
```

If knitting this document doesn't work using the knit button try this:
`rmarkdown::render(here::here("directions.rmd"))`

### Functions included

* `RelConditionEPU.R` - This is the main function for calculating the condition factor
* `connect_to_database.R` - Provides a connection to "sole"
* `pull_from_svdbs.R` - Executed sql query and pulls data from SVDBS database
* `plot_condition.R` - plots the output of `RelConditionEPU.R`.
* `utilities.R` - collection of small functions used in plotting
* `install_cond_packages.R` - installs all required packages (This will eventually be redundant since we will turn into
an R package)
#* `gam_calcs.R` - where GAM analyses are done. NOT CODED YET

### Data included

* `lw_parameters_Condition.csv` - These are the static length-weight parameters used to calulate predicted weight at a given length by species and sex. Individual fish lengths and weights from the autumn NEFSC bottom trawl survey were used to calculate length-weight parameters below:
Weight = e^(COEFFICIENT_FALL)*Length^(EXPONENT_FALL)
Where length is in cm and weight is in kg.
* `NEFSC_survey_data_8-15-19.RDS` - This is a data pull (taken Aug. 15th, 2019) of NEFSC fall bottom trawl survey data including species, sex, individual fish lengths and weights, bottom temperature, stomach volume, local population abundance (expcatchnum) and biomass (expcatchwt).


### Running Code

``` {r run, echo=T, eval=F, message=F} 
# source the main function (When this is turned into a package, this will not be necessary)
source("R/RelConditionEPU.R")
# calculate condition factor. 
# First time using set pullNewData = T
condition <- RelConditionEPU(pullNewData = TRUE, out.dir="output")
# plot results
plot_condition(condition$annualcond, filename = "condition_2018", out.dir="output")
# analysis
gam_calcs(condition$stom,out.dir="output")

```

### Main function

The argument `pullNewData` is a boolean indicating whether to pull directly from the SVDBS database (TRUE) (for which you'll need to enter Oracle credentials) or to use a previously pulled dat set (FALSE, which is quicker!)
The argument `out.dir` specifies the name of the output directory that will be created (within the current working directory) to store output files
``` {r main, echo=T, eval=T, message=F} 
condition <- RelConditionEPU(pullNewData = TRUE, out.dir="output")
print(condition$annualcond)
print(head(condition$stom))
```

### Plotting

Use the function `plot_condition`. It currently takes the argument condition$annualcond which is the output from the main function. You'll need to pass a character string for the name of the output jpg created. See the header of the function for "help" 
``` {r plot, echo=T, eval=T, message=F} 
#These aren't working:
condMat <- plot_condition(condition$annualcond,filename = "condition_2019", out.dir = "output")

condGOM <- plot_condition(annualCondition=condSS, filename = "GOM_condition_2019", out.dir = "output")

condMat <- plot_condition(annualCondition=condGB, filename = "GB_condition_2019", out.dir = "output")
                          
condMat <- plot_condition(annualCondition=condMAB, filename = "MAB_condition_2019", out.dir = "output")
                          
condMat <- plot_condition(annualCondition=condSS, filename = "SS_condition_2019", out.dir = "output")                          

#Used these for 2019 SOE instead:
#condShelf <- plot_condition(condNshelfSpp,filename = "Shelf_condition_2019", out.dir = "output")
condShelf <- plot_condition(condGOM,filename = "GOM_condition_2019", out.dir = "output")
condShelf <- plot_condition(condGB,filename = "GB_condition_2019", out.dir = "output")
condShelf <- plot_condition(condMAB,filename = "MAB_condition_2019", out.dir = "output")

```

``` {r getplot, echo=F, eval=T, message=F} 
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("output","condition_2019.jpg"))

```



### Gam stuff

This function exists but is not complete
#``` {r gam, echo=T, eval=F, message=F} 
#gam_calcs(condition$stom,out.dir = "output")
#```
